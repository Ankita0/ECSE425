#ECSE425 Project

The repository is broken down into assignment submissions, namely:

##Assignment 3: Caches

##Assignment 4: The Pipeline Processor

    To insert the instruction memory, change the file path in line 44 in "instruction_memory.vhd"
    basically, change the bold part in : file_open(file_name, **"P:\ECSE_425\processor_test\Mips_test1.txt"**,READ_MODE);
    It does not write to file, yet.
